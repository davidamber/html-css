HTML uses tags to identify page content. <i> This text, for example, is a<b> paragraph</b></i>

<h1>Page Content</h1>
<p>The main page content appears inside the <b>body </b>tag. HTML contains several elements that allow you to properly structure and format your <br/>
  content, which we'll cover later. </p>

<h1>Content models</h1>
<p>Content models In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <b>Block level </b> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while <b>inline level </b> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p>
<p>In this example the <b>heading 1</b> and the <b>paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
<p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: <b>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning.</b> To learn more about them, visit the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html">interactive graphic</a> contained in the W3C HTML5 specification.</p>
